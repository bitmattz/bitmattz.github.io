> I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success . . . Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything. (Nikola Tesla)



## **Who I am?**
Hello! My name is Matheus Bitencourt and I'm a software developer. Besides programming, I also like create projects using my 3D printer and eletronics.
I always consider important for learning, create projects, even if they are useless, so I thought interesting create a place to share my projects and ideas.
I've always believed that creating projects is an essential part of the learning process, even if they don't have a practical application. That's why I was excited to create a space where I can share my projects and ideas.

## **Journey**

### **2017**
I started my studies in programming in **2017**, at the **SÃ£o Paulo Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology - Salto Campus**. During the first year I learned **C**, **hardware concepts**, **Operating systems**, and **computer networks**. 

### **2018**
In my second year, I learned to develop desktop applications using **C#**, integrate applications with the **Postgres** database, and **Analyze and Model Systems**. I consider **2018** to be the year that sparked my greatest interest in the IT field, using **C#** to create **desktop applications**, integrating with **databases**, learning **computer networks**, **systems modeling**, **participating in projects**, and **presenting at educational events at IFSP**.

### **2019**

In my last year of technical school, I learned **Java** for **web** and **Android** development, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I also completed more school projects and seminars at school events. During 2019, I became more curious about learning new languages and tools that are up-to-date with the market, because even with the great curriculum of my technical course, the market was experiencing new trends, such as **mobile development** using **Flutter** or **React Native**. And it was precisely these technologies that I learned and practiced in personal and school projects.

### **2020 - 2021/July**

After finishing high school integrated with **IT technician**, I decided not to go straight to college. I started working as a salesperson and, in my free time, I studied and experimented with new technologies. I took some **Node** and **React** courses, and I also did some study projects with **Typescript**, using **Node** on the **backend** and **React** on the **frontend**. Out of curiosity, I also learned **Python**, which I consider to be a very flexible language with many useful libraries. Although I haven't created any "practical" projects in **Python**, I've done them all for fun. I have some examples on my **github** if you are interested.

It was only after high school that I really started to enjoy studying and feel a great desire to learn more. I explored various subjects, even outside my area, such as **electromagnetism**, **electricity**, **electronics**, and **physics**.

Until July 2021, it was a phase of discoveries, where I learned to learn and practice my skills.

### **2021/Aug - 2024/Mar**

In August 2021, I reached two important milestones: I started a college degree in **Systems Analysis and Development** at **FIAP** and I also got the opportunity to work as a **Developer** at **VILT**.

#### **FIAP**

In my undergraduate studies, I delved into concepts already covered in technical school, applying them directly to my **TCC** project. Throughout my two years of study, I participated in several events at **FIAP**, where I had the opportunity to create projects, attend lectures, and participate in group challenges.

During my **Final Project**, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a fantastic team, where I learned a lot about teamwork and project management. Our **Final Project** aimed to **develop an application** to help communities of family farmers promote and sell their products. I was responsible for the **Backend**, we chose to use **Java** because I already had experience with this language, both from college and from my work at **VILT**. I developed an **authentication system** using **JWT**. We could have used a ready-made library like **KeyCloak** to simplify the process, but I decided to do it from scratch to fully understand how the **authentication and encryption flow** worked. It was, by far, the project where I learned the most about **Backend**.

#### **VILT**

At **VILT**, I started by participating in internal workshops on the **Opentext CMS** called **WEM (Web Experience Management)**. There, I developed some training applications using **Java** and **JSP** to create pages in **WEM**.

After completing the training period, I started to integrate projects in large clients as a developer. In this process, I deepened my knowledge of **Java** and also gained experience with **Oracle** database, **Linux** servers, **React**, and **Keycloak** for **authentication** in logged-in areas.

In 2022, I participated in several demands that led me to learn about the concept of **Spring Batch**, developing several **Batch** applications in **Java**. I really liked this concept and applied it to some personal projects.

In the second half of 2022, I was assigned to work as **technical support** within the project I was working on, where I answered tickets to **fix bugs in the production system**. This brought me more contact with the **infrastructure** area, where I solved issues both in the application and in the project's **servers**.

In 2023, I was allocated to a new client, where I also worked as **support**. In this project, I had more interactions with clients and gained a deeper understanding of how the **corporate environment** and **business rules** work. I was challenged to learn how to read and understand **legacy code** to **fix bugs**, which I consider a valuable experience. The support role taught me a lot about **code analysis and problem-solving**, which helped me become a better programmer. When we face a problem in the system, it is essential to understand the entire application process to identify the cause of the error.

In 2024, in addition to working on **code maintenance** and **developing new features** in various projects using **WEM**, I also learned another tool widely used by **VILT**: **Adobe's CMS**, **AEM (Adobe Experience Manager)**. I participated in a **proof of concept (POC)** for a large client, where I worked in a team to create a complete website using various **Adobe** tools, such as **AEM**, **Target**, **Analytics**, **Workfront**, and **Assets**. I was responsible for creating components and pages using **AEM**.




## **What's Next?** 
{{< figure

At the beginning of 2024, I realized that it was time to start a new chapter in my life. Until then, each phase of my journey had lasted about three years, so I felt it was time to start a new era. I have always had a desire to know new cultures and live experiences abroad, so I decided to do an exchange to Australia.

I am currently preparing to go to **Australia** in May, I will stay 8 months in **Brisbane** to take an **English course** at **ILSC**. I intend to post articles here about **Australia** and the **exchange**, and when I return, I will post about my **new projects**.

I really wanted to have a place where I could post more about myself, but in a resume or profile description on a social network it would not be possible to address all this, I have great plans for what is to come, but it is already a special place to tell my story.
